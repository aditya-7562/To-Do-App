## How It Works

The To-Do App operates with a straightforward and intuitive workflow to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the app works:

1. **Add a Task:**
   - Enter the task you want to add into the input field.
   - Click the "Add" button to add the task to the to-do list.
   - If the input field is empty, an alert will prompt you to write something.

2. **View Task List:**
   - Tasks are displayed in an unordered list (`<ul>`) under the "To-Do List" heading.

3. **Mark Task as Completed:**
   - Click on a task in the list to mark it as completed.
   - Completed tasks are visually distinguished by a strikethrough text.

4. **Remove a Task:**
   - Hover over a task in the list to reveal a small "X" button on the right.
   - Click the "X" button to remove the task from the list.

5. **Local Storage:**
   - Tasks are saved locally using the browser's local storage.
   - This means that your to-do list will persist even if you close the browser or refresh the page.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

By following these simple steps, users can easily manage their tasks, keep track of completed items, and maintain an organized to-do list. The integration of local storage ensures that your tasks are securely stored for future reference.
